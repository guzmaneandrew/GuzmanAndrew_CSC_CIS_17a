he who stings with his tail will get a beating
he who nears a good tree is blanketed by good shade
old harp of my mother-in-law you are no longer fit to play
white is my name and i sweeten the life of man
the mariachi simon is playing his big mandolin
the bricklayer drank so much that he ended up like a barrel
the shrimp that slumbers is taken by the tides
so often does the jug go to the water that it breaks and wets your slip
sir ferruco in the poplar grove wanted to toss away his cane
the attention i pay you is little
do not miss me my heart i'll be back by bus
parrot land here and chat with me
behave yourself buddy or the little red one will take you away
first you throw away the outside then you cook the inside then you eat the outside and throw away the inside
the one that sang for st peter will never sing for him again
put the bonnet on the baby lest he catch a cold
everybody knows how to open it nobody knows how to close it
give it to me or take it from me
this world is a ball and we a great mob
the musician has oiled his horn now he doesn't want to play for me
people go to see the prickly pear cactus only when it bears fruit
you have me hopping here and there like a bird on a branch
for the sun and the rain
the one who dies by its mouth even if he were mute
fresh and fragrant beautiful in any season
next to the rockrose and the thyme on the mountain i kneel
the blanket of the poor
one two and three the soldier heads to the fort
don't you wrinkle dear old leather since i want you for a drum
it is usually drunk accompanied by salt and lemon
why do you run coward having such a good blade too
jumping it goes searching but it doesn't see anything
growing it reached the heavens and since it wasn't a violin it had to be a cello.
beat it silly with a stick do not let it near me
green white and red the flag of the soldier
a boot the same as the other
as i passed by the cemetery i found myself a skull
you with the bell and i with your sister
she rows and rows sitting in her little boat
the best compliment for a cup of coffee
the hat of kings
the lady taking an elegant walk along the main street
ascend me step by step don't try and skip
the sailor's guide
white i am and as my neighbor says i am always useful in the kitchen
the street lamp of lovers
he who is born to be a flowerpot will never leave the corridor
the hand of a man
palmer climb the palmtree and bring me a coconut fit for kings
he who waits despairs
what a jump your sister gave as she saw the green frog
rosita rosaura come as i want you here now
the swollen belly that juan had was from eating too much watermelon
the arrows strike where they hit
