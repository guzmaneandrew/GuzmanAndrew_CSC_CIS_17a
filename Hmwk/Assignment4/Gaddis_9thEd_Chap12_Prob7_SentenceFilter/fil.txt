I'm very happy that i was able to solve this problem. Whenever i have a hard time on a problem and i give myself a break from it, i come back with a clear mind and am able to solve it. It's so cool because i was literally thinking about how to solve it throughout the day but not actually working on it. Somehow my brain was able to figure it out without actually doing anything, just thoughts.
